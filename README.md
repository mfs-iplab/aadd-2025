# AADD-2025: Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors Challenge

## 1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media

**Grand Challenge at [ACM Multimedia 2025](https://acmmm2025.org/)**

---

## 🎯 Overview

The AADD-2025 Challenge investigated adversarial vulnerabilities of deepfake detection models by generating adversarial perturbed deepfake images that evade state-of-the-art classifiers while maintaining high visual similarity to the original deepfake content. Given the increasing reliance on deepfake detectors in forensic analysis and content moderation, ensuring their robustness against adversarial attacks is of paramount importance.

## 🎪 Challenge Description

The goal of this challenge was to expose and address vulnerabilities in current deepfake detection systems by designing adversarial attacks that alter deepfake images—rendering them unrecognizable as synthetic content to 4 proposed classifiers—while preserving high visual similarity to the original images.

## 📊 Dataset Structure

Participants were provided with a dataset divided into **sixteen subsets**:

### High Quality Resolution:
- **4 GAN-based models** (high quality)
- **4 Diffusion-based models** (high quality)

### Low Quality Resolution:
- **4 GAN-based models** (low quality)
- **4 Diffusion-based models** (low quality)

**Note**: Participants had to focus on the entire dataset across all subsets.

## 📋 Submission Requirements

1. **Adversarial Images**: Submit the generated adversarial deepfake images
2. **Technical Abstract**: Provide a detailed description of your methodology
3. **Results Documentation**: Include performance metrics and analysis
